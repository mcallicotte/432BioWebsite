                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Howdy! My name is Mary Callicotte, and I am a senior computer science student graduating this May. 
                    I enjoy board games, running, video games, and music.
                </p>

                <h2>Why Am I Taking Accessible Computing?</h2>
                <p>
                    I took Human Computer Interaction last semester, and I really enjoyed it.
                    One of my biggest takeaways from that class was that  accessible design is <strong>required</strong> for good design. 
                    I want to learn more about accessable computing so that I can use this knowledge to improve my designs.
                </p>

                <h2>Website Font</h2>
                <p>
                    You might have noticed the font on this website is a bit unique.
                    That is because I am using a font called <em>Atkinson Hyperlegible</em>, 
                    a font created by the <a href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont">Braille Institute</a> for increased ledgibility for people with low vison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-load-and-use-custom-fonts-with-css">this website</a>
                    as a guide for how to add custom fonts.
                </p>
